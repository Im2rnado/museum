He founded the cities of Ismailia and Port Said and developed much of what is modern-day known as Khedivial Cairo. His development projects included the establishment of cultural institutions, such as the Bulaq &nbsp;&nbsp;Museum, Opera House, and Giza Zoo. The Suez Canal was inaugurated during his reign, in 1869, and its ceremony was attended by many notable members of European royal families.</p>
