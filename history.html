                    global campaign for the establishment of the
                    Nubia Museum in Aswan and NMEC in Cairo. The existing design, by an Egyptian architect, was the
                    winner of an
                    international architectural competition.

                    <br><br>

                    In 1999, the joint efforts of the Egyptian Government resulted in finding a suitable site at
                    Al-Fustat neighborhood for
                    the birthplace of the NMEC project. This specific site was chosen instead of the previously selected
                    one, currently
                    known as “Opera”.

                    <br><br>

                    NMEC’s foundation stone was laid in 2002, despite the archeological excavations that took place at
                    the museum’s areas
                    since the early 2000s. The joint efforts of UNESCO, the Egyptian Authorities, and the Ministry of
                    Culture collectively
                    aimed at establishing a museological institution that reflects the various cultural aspects of
                    Egypt’s rich history
                    through adopting aesthetically and technologically advanced methods used at the 21st renowned
                    museums.
