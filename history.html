            <p class="about-content">In 1982, UNESCO has launched at the request of the Egyptian government, a
                global campaign for the establishment of the
                Nubia Museum in Aswan and NMEC in Cairo. The existing design, by an Egyptian architect, was the
                winner of an
                international architectural competition.

                <br><br>

                In 1999, the joint efforts of the Egyptian Government resulted in finding a suitable site at
                Al-Fustat neighborhood for
                the birthplace of the NMEC project. This specific site was chosen instead of the previously selected
                one, currently
                known as “Opera”.

                <br><br>

                NMEC’s foundation stone was laid in 2002, despite the archeological excavations that took place at
                the museum’s areas
                since the early 2000s. The joint efforts of UNESCO, the Egyptian Authorities, and the Ministry of
                Culture collectively
                aimed at establishing a museological institution that reflects the various cultural aspects of
                Egypt’s rich history
                through adopting aesthetically and technologically advanced methods used at the 21st renowned
                museums.
